## 📌 *Hackathon Project: GenAI Multi-Agent Healthcare System*

# 🧠🚑 HealthGuard Agents – Multi-Agent AI Healthcare Companion

This repository contains a *multi-agent AI healthcare system* developed for the *GenAI Hackathon*, designed to monitor health, predict disease risks, and provide personalized wellness recommendations using autonomous AI agents.

---

## 🎯 *Objective*

To develop an intelligent healthcare companion using *AI agents, machine learning, and user health data* in order to:

* Predict early-stage disease risks
* Understand user symptoms through triage-style questioning
* Monitor lifestyle patterns like sleep, stress, diet, and activity
* Generate personalized care plans
* Offer daily health coaching
* Send real-time alerts when risk factors increase

---

## 🧰 *Tools and Technologies Used*

* Python
* Node.js / FastAPI
* LangChain / AutoGen (Multi-Agent Framework)
* OpenAI / Llama Models
* Scikit-learn
* Firebase / MongoDB
* Flutter / React Native

---

## 🩺 *System Overview*

HealthGuard Agents is powered by *five specialized AI agents* that work together like a virtual medical team:

* *Lifestyle & Behavior Agent* – tracks habits and detects irregular patterns
* *Symptom & Triage Agent* – analyzes symptoms and asks medical questions
* *Predictive Health Agent* – computes disease risk scores
* *Medical Knowledge Agent* – explains health conditions and precautions
* *Care Plan Agent* – generates diet, exercise, and stress-relief plans

## 📦 *Dataset / Models Used*

This project uses ML models trained on:

* PIMA Diabetes Dataset
* UCI Heart Disease Dataset
* NHANES Lifestyle Dataset

Models used include:

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* LightGBM
* LLM-based reasoning models
